It can be use as a picture library or a portafolio to show your work or the work of your client. It is basically inspired by the work of [franciscopugh
](https://github.com/franciscopugh/dynamic-portfolio).

In this project 2 great javascript libraries were used: 
1. [Murri](https://github.com/haltu/muuri): Used the organize the contents and to allow filtering
2. [Photoswipe](https://github.com/dimsemenov/PhotoSwipe): Used to display the element on full screen adding more personalized options

Both using vanilla Javascript and their documentations are available in the links provided above.
